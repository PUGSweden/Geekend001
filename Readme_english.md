Why?
Because it’s so damn fun with PowerShell!

Theme
To build a Powershell solution togheter and sessions

The suggestion is to build a graphical Helpdesk application or we can brainstorm other suggestions.
But the goal with Geekend is to meet and socialize with other PowerShell Geeks. 

Plus short open spontaneous sessions for those who feel compelled or on request. Bring your projects and get tips, ideas and help!

This is not a Corporate event. It’s an event by PowerShell Geeks for PowerShell Geeks on all levels.
